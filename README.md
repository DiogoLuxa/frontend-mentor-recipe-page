## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Website

### What I learned

In this project I learned, mainly, to read a project in Figma and pass the measures to code. The layout helped a lot to modularize the sections and how I would write the code in HTML to later adjust it in CSS, which in this case, was preferably using Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [The 7-1 Pattern](https://www.educative.io/courses/sass-for-css/the-7-1-pattern) - This article helped me a lot to organize my Sass folders.
